The Old Man and the Sea tells the story of a battle between an aging 
experienced fisherman Santiago and a large marlin 
The story opens with Santiago having gone 84 days without catching a fish 
and now being seen as salao the worst form of unluckiness
He is so unlucky that his young apprentice Manolin 
has been forbidden by his parents to sail with him 
and has been told instead to fish with successful fishermen 
The boy visits Santiagos shack each night
hauling his fishing gear preparing food 
talking about American baseball and his favorite player 
Santiago tells Manolin that on the next day 
he will venture far out into the Gulf Stream
north of Cuba in the Straits of Florida to fish 
confident that his unlucky streak is near its end
